        <p class="founder-bio">Ibby had the idea for this company when he was just 5 years old. The concept was simple:
        use a time machine, or magic, to bring in a bunch of characters from the past and make a website for children's
      puzzle games. After 15 years of mad-scientist/magic training the dream finally became
       a reality.</p>

        <p class="founder-bio">Raised on the plains of mongolia over 800 years ago, and best known for
        basically taking over the world, Genghis (or G-man as his friends affectionately call him)
      has become surprisingly mellow recently with an uncanny talent for JavaScript.</p>

        <p class="founder-bio">Over a thousand years ago he was the holy roman emperor, ruling over most
        of western europe. These days he's a bit of a CSS fiend and a heck of a dancer, but he still likes
      it when we call him emperor.</p>

        <p class="founder-bio">When she was queen her reforms bought the crime rates down to unprecedented levels,
