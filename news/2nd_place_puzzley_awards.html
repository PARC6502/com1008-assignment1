      <h1>2nd Place Puzzley Awards</h1>
      <p>We are proud to announce that after the release of our new hit, original, genre-bending game
      <a href="../games/match_the_pairs.html">"Match the pairs"</a> we were nominated for the puzzley awards!
    As you all probably know, the puzzley awards are the world's foremost puzzle awards and have veterans such as
  Erno Rubik (inventor of the Rubiks cube), and John Spilsbury (inventor of the jigsaw puzzle). In this elite
contest we were very elated to win secodn place. We are sure that our upcoming game, Kubir, will get us first place in the
